# React Demo

## Code Scaffolding

### Nivo
It takes the [nivo](https://github.com/plouc/nivo) official React library, built on top if d3, and build a website where you can test the functionality of Nivo.\
This repository aims to build responsive examples for all the major functionality of the Nivo library.
This repository has been made because the official repository does not offer a good example section.
